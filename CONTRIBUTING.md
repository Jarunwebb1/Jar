Create a CONTRIBUTING file:

In your local repository directory, create a new file named "CONTRIBUTING" without any file extension. You can use a text editor or any other suitable tool for this.
Inside the file, provide guidelines for contributors. You can include information about how to contribute, coding conventions, branch naming conventions, pull request guidelines, and any other relevant information.
Add the CONTRIBUTING file to your repository:

Go to your GitHub repository page.
Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files" from the drop-down menu.
Choose the CONTRIBUTING file you created in the previous step and upload it to your repository.
Update the README file with a link to the CONTRIBUTING file:

Open the README.md file in your repository.
Edit the README file using a text editor or the GitHub web interface.
Add a section or a subsection in the README file that provides a brief overview of the contribution guidelines.
Include a link to the CONTRIBUTING file. You can use the following Markdown syntax: [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING). Make sure the link matches the filename and extension of your CONTRIBUTING file.
Commit and push the changes:

Once you have made the necessary changes to the README file, commit your changes with an appropriate commit message.
Push the changes to your GitHub repository.
Verify the changes:

Go to your GitHub repository page and navigate to the README file.
Click on the link you added for the contribution guidelines. It should redirect you to the CONTRIBUTING file, displaying the contribution guidelines you specified.
By following these steps, you will have successfully added contribution guidelines and a link to the CONTRIBUTING file in your GitHub repository's README file.
